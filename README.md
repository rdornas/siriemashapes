# siriemashapes

siriemashapes is a package designed to facilitate the manipulation of data from Hotspot analysis from Siriema software (http://www.ufrgs.br/siriema/).

The package generates a spatial data frame with Hotspot analysis results, as well as a data frame listing the number of events for each taxon in each sample unit.

To install the package:

```
devtools::install_github('rdornas/siriemashapes')
```

WARNING: For best (and accurate) results, it is strongly recommended that the Hotspot analysis be performed taking into account the number of divisions set to double the radius.
